# react-book-search

This project demonstrates the entire MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. A user can search for books on Google. They can view the books or save them. On the Saved Books page they can delete them.

Additionally, the project also uses socket.io to alert all users in the app when a book is saved and the title of that book.
